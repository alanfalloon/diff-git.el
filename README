This package adds commands for working with the Git index from within
`diff-mode'.

When splitting up commits and other fine juggling of staged and
unstaged changes, `diff-mode' offers a number of advantages:
specifically `diff-reverse-direction' and `diff-split-hunk' are
extremely useful for teasing apart changes.

The major commands are: `diff-git-hunk-stage' which takes the hunk
under the point and stages it in the index; `diff-git-diff-staged'
which makes a new diff buffer showing the staged changes in the file;
and `diff-git-diff-unstaged' which shows the unstaged changes.

The staged and unstaged diff buffers are refreshed when
`diff-git-hunk-stage' is run, or when the file they are tracking is
saved.

This extension was written and tested on GNU Emacs 23.0.91.1. To use
this extension you will require magit 0.7 and vc-git (included with
emacs)
