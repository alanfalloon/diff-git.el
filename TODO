* Make `diff-git-stage-hunk' unstage the hunk if its being run from the staged changes buffer
* The update hooks are not being properly removed when the buffers are closed
* Add `diff-git-unload-hook' that returns the key bindings and unloads all the hooks
* Run the hooks when changes are made via magit or the standard git modes
* Add command to see all (un)staged changes
* Refresh doesn't properly work on multifile changesets done from `vc-dir'
* `diff-git-diff-staged' and `diff-git-diff-unstaged' only work in `vc-dir' at the root
* `diff-git-hunk-stage' should stage first hunk when point at top of file instead of failing
